        Constructs a new SHT3x I²C command.

        :param int/None command:
            The command ID to be sent to the device. None means that no
            command will be sent, i.e. only ``tx_data`` (if not None) will
            be sent. No CRC is added to these bytes since the command ID
            usually already contains a CRC.
        :param bytes-like/list/None tx_data:
            Bytes to be extended with CRCs and then sent to the I²C device.
            None means that no write header will be sent at all (if ``command``
            is None too). An empty list means to send the write header (even if
            ``command`` is None), but without data following it.
        :param int/None rx_length:
            Number of bytes to be read from the I²C device, including CRC
            bytes. None means that no read header is sent at all. Zero means
            to send the read header, but without reading any data.
        :param float read_delay:
            Delay (in Seconds) to be inserted between the end of the write
            operation and the beginning of the read operation. This is needed
            if the device needs some time to prepare the RX data, e.g. if it
            has to perform a measurement. Set to 0.0 to indicate that no delay
            is needed, i.e. the device does not need any processing time.
        :param float timeout:
            Timeout (in Seconds) to be used in case of clock stretching. If the
            device stretches the clock longer than this value, the transceive
            operation will be aborted with a timeout error. Set to 0.0 to
            indicate that the device will not stretch the clock for this
            command.
        :param float post_processing_time:
            Maximum time in seconds the device needs for post processing of
            this command until it is ready to receive the next command. For
            example after a device reset command, the device might need some
            time until it is ready again. Usually this is 0.0s, i.e. no post
            processing is needed.
